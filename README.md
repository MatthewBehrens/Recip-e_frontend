# Recip-e

Recip-e allows you to search for recipes using the ingredients that you have in your kitchen or pantry. With a simple to use mobile first interface you can add and remove items to your pantry list and search any combination of them for recipes.

All recipes come from Spoonacular's recipes database, which contains over 330,000 recipes.

This application is the product of a hackathon project for Dev Bootcamp's Web Developer program. The goal was to create a fully functioning application that solved an everyday problem. None of the team members had any previous experience developing mobile applications.
